# Old Movies Directory Web App

## Made with Streamlit and Pure python.

## Link to the google cloud hosted app: https://primeval-sweep-331023.uc.r.appspot.com/

##### Sorry for the inconvenience as the link above is showing 502 server error. The project is linked to my University account on the google cloud platform. And to deploy an app on the engine, we need credits, since it was my university account, we were provided with limit credit funding and the billing cycle cannot be reopened.

# NOTE: YOU CAN ACCESS MY PROJECT BY FORKING THE PROJECT FROM GITHUB, AND RUNNING THE WEBSITE USING ```streamlit run app.py```
